# p.post

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of p.post is to populate a spreadsheet with the number of successes required, given number of subjects \eqn{n} supplied, relating to the posterior probability of the underlying success rate, p_post.  Thus, it ensures $P({\sf p\\_post}>p_1)$, where: 

* $N$: **Number of subjects**.  The number of successes are calculated for a sample size $n = 1,\dots,N$.
* $p_1$: **Threshold for probability of success**.
* $p_2$: **Threshold for posterior probability**.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of p.post from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("reevesj53/p.post")
```
## Example
The code below shows an example of output for a success rate of 0.3, and a posterior probability of exceeding the success rate ranging from 0.5 to 0.8.  Number of required successes are computed for a range of n, from 1 to 80.

```{r example}
library(p.post)
p1 <- 0.3
p2 <- seq(0.5, 0.8, 0.1)
post_prob <- calc_post(80, p1, p2)
```
The resulting data frame is shown below.
```{r out}
post_prob
```
The data frame can be output to an excel file, with a separate sheet for each of the success probabilities, [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8].  Run the R function $\dots$
```{r excel, eval = FALSE}
excel_out(post_prob)
```
The excel file below will by default be saved in the R working directory.
